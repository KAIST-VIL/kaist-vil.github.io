introduction: |
  Vehicular Intelligence Lab is focused on the implementation and verification of intelligent mobility systems.<br>
  We are particularly interested in control and perception of mobility.<br>
  Also, we are engaged with energy management systems, theoretically and practically.<br>
  To participate in our research, background knowledge on <strong>AI, RL, CV, NLP, Robotics</strong> and/or <strong>Control systems</strong> is required.<br>
  If you have knowledge of some of these areas, you are welcome.<br>
  If not, you are still welcome on the condition that you will do your best.<br><br>
  The level of intelligence depends on what you do when you have problems.<br>
  The goal of research works being carried out by the lab is to elevate your current level of intelligence to a higher level.<br>
  However, we just give you a chance, and it's up to you to get to a higher level.<br><br>
